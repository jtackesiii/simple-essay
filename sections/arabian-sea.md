Mozoomdar returned alone to the SS Khedive, for Dharmapala had other
travel arrangements. Over the next week-and-a-half amid the throes of
the Arabian Sea, he wrote to his wife nearly every day. Though several
of Mozoomdar's letters express longing for Saudamini's voice and
cooking, his sharpest desire appears to have been to micromanage her
life, even from afar.

In a telling sequence, he backtracks from the
sentiment that his journey might allow Saudamini some rest from her
wifely duties by proceeding to barrage her with rhetorical questions to
the effect that she constantly apply herself toward sacred
conduct [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 12-13.]. In another passage, his very desire to hear from her, far
from the heartfelt pleas found in Indian love stories, becomes another
attempt to control her lifestyle: he writes, "news of your happiness,
your wellbeing, your following the Brahma-*vrata* [In the context of the passage, this *vrata* or vow likely refers
    to maintaining a lifestyle of overall austerity for the benefit of
    not only the vow-taker (in this case, Saudamini), but also her
    husband. Such vows were common obligations of Bengali wives at this
    time. See @walsh-2004-DomesticityColonialIndia, 36.] like I did, you
getting along with everyone around you will help my work
profoundly." [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 18-19.] The intimacy among these letters is, predictably for
this period, that of a husband who assumes the right to control his
wife's affairs [Although the Brahmo Samaj meant to improve the lives of women
    through their reforms, they never intended to free women from the
    domestic obligation of serving their husbands. See @walsh-2004-DomesticityColonialIndia, 42-46.].

Yet his letters during this period tell of more than a husband at pains
to assert power over his wife. Mozoomdar often wrote of cloudless days
of sultry heat and stormy nights that rattled the ship and its
passengers. Though he insisted he never felt seasick and declared that
the ocean voyage made him stronger, PCM complained of poor health during
this stretch of travel: the heat kept him from sleep, the wind and the
dampness made him feel ill, and he could not shake the pain from one of
his hands [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 17-18.].

These rapid transformations in the weather did more than affect his
health. On his third day out from Colombo, Mozoomdar wrote to Saudamini
of black waves tearing into the hull of the SS Khedive in the manner of
cannonballs and sheets of rain that transformed nature itself into the
terrifying form of the goddess Bhairavi [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 13-15.].

Inspired by the tempest,
Mozoomdar wrote an article for *The Interpreter*, a Kolkata-based
journal he edited. The refrain in this piece, titled "The Raging Sea,"
as well as in his letters to Saudamini at this time, is to seek refuge
in God, for "the unerring of the great Captain shall steer us to the
harbor duly." [@mozoomdar-1893-RagingSea, 27.] More than fear of domestic powerlessness,
Mozoomdar's consistent calls for trust in God's will to both Saudamini
and the readers of *The Interpreter* suggest a desire to maintain social
ties with loved ones in the way he knew best - by preaching God's
presence. As will be shown, Mozoomdar felt more and more lonely *en
route* to London.
