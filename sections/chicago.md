At long last, nearly two months since his departure from Kolkata,
Mozoomdar reached Chicago. Although cheerful upon his arrival, convinced
that everything he saw at the World's Fair was graced with God's
presence, PCM soon became disheartened by lack of news from Saudamini.
In the first of several letters written to her in Chicago, he attempts
to console himself by insisting that despite his longing to see his
wife, she "wouldn't have been able to tolerate the journey" and
therefore rightly remained in Kolkata [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 44-45.]. Yet his despondence worsened
as the beginning of the parliament approached. On the evening of
September 10, hours before the conference would begin, he wrote:

> I feel lonely and tired. I wondered why I haven't received your letters
yet. Then I saw your handwriting. I feel numb and absent-minded. Write
to me. Write anything. Whatever you write will be good for me. It will
calm my mind, and also be good for you. Can't you write a few lines to
the one for whom you have done so much? I want to scold you, but my eyes
tear up instead.... I think about you a lot. I don't know whether you
think of me. Heaven will mean nothing to me if I'm there and you aren't.
I will pray for hell, then.... I await your hopeful voice in this
foreign land. Don't hesitate to make yourself known [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 46-47.].

It was not until over a week later that the longed-for letter arrived,
postmarked 9 August. Preoccupied with the proceedings of the World's
Parliament of Religions, PCM's response indicates that he was impatient
with his wife's brevity, feeling too busy himself to write everything
down [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 49-50.]. He also had doubts about his ability to keep in touch with
her during the remaining three months of his stay in the US. These
doubts appear to have been well-founded, for the final letter in the
series ends mid-sentence: "I should have addressed all my letters via
Spears, because I don't know how they will be delivered if I change my
address. And my American address..." [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 51-52. This abrupt ending marks the end of the final extant
    page of the preserved letters, and suggests that all subsequent
    pages have been lost. Though Mozoomdar's health was poor, nothing
    indicates that he stopped writing during his remaining time in the
    US. Unfortunately, no records of Saudamini's letters to PCM exist."]
