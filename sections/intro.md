Protap Chunder Mozoomdar (PCM) was one of the first Indians to command
an audience in the United States of America, perhaps best-known for his
participation in the 1893 Chicago World's Fair. A
prominent member of the Brahmo Samaj, a Bengal-based community of Hindu
reformers, Mozoomdar first captured the imagination of Europeans and
Americans in 1883. At that time, his lectures across America's eastern
seaboard (not to mention the publication of his book, *The Oriental
Christ*) enamored liberal Christians such as Jenkin Lloyd Jones, a
Unitarian minister who would help organize the World's Parliament of
Religions in conjuction with the World's Fair in
Chicago [@mullick-2010-FirstHinduMission, 95.]. PCM attended and addressed this parliament in order to rally support for the New Dispensation, a Brahmo Samaj vision of global
religious confraternity that he hoped would mark the end of religious
sectarianism and restore the prominence of an emotional, rather than
intellectual, pursuit of God. 

Mozoomdar's narrative is generally told in order to account for nineteenth-century Indian religious responses to British colonialism. Yet his persona is often eclipsed by the dueling shadows cast by Swami Vivekananda and Keshub Chunder Sen. For both reasons, PCM has rarely been the subject of his own story. By attending to Mozoomdar's private life in the months that prefaced his addresses at the World's Parliament of Religions, based on letters he wrote to his wife Saudamini, "Mozoomdar at Sea" enables a fuller appreciation of these Chicago lectures, his hope for the New Dispensation, and the legacy of his religious mission.
