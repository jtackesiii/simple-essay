> The fortress-ridden shores of Spain on one side and the mountain ranges
of Africa, devoid of people or greens, on the other. We are sailing up
the narrow stream in between. The water is peaceful, the wind is cool,
and the sunlight feels beautiful. I am filled with hope, and the place
of my work lies ahead of me [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 32.].

Though Mozoomdar never mentioned the Pillars of Hercules as he passed
through the Strait of Gibraltar, they held true as a symbolic threshold
to a utopian beyond. He believed the promise of the imminent New
Dispensation lie in wait for him across the Atlantic. Yet Mozoomdar saw
more than Chicago on the horizon. Though speedily approaching London,
where he would give several sermons, PCM wrote to his wife of the future
he saw for them upon his homecoming:

> I will return home a new man. You will also probably be a new person by
then. I won't get angry at you or annoy you any more with my tedious
intolerances. You will also not be angry at me or deride my actions. If
God is near, this will be possible and we'll know [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 32.].
