After a stretch of ten days at sea, PCM arrived in Aden on 28 July.
Instead of the excitement one might expect from someone finally able to
stretch his legs, his letters give evidence of a man pained at the
distance from his loved ones. After receiving and reading his first
batch of reply mail from the port city, Mozoomdar gushes over the chance
to read his wife's writing:

> Only you can write this way. I feel blessed to read it. I read it again
and again. I plan to read it more during my journey.... No matter how
low a husband is, the dutiful care of his wife will lead to her own
greatness. I hope I can someday become worthy of your love and
respect [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 19-20.].

Compare that excitement with his distaste for the crowds of Aden: "I
have never been one for company. I don't like the babble of people. I am
lonely in the truest sense of the term, waiting patiently to gain His
eternal company." [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 20-21.]Â Again, the unhappiness of Mozoomdar's solitude
manifests a longing for proximity to God.
