Despite failing health, Mozoomdar continued to lecture in the US until
early December, spending most of his time in Boston. In total, he was
said to have delivered almost 200 lectures during his three months in
the country in 1893 [@bose-1927-LifeProtapChunder, 202-3.]. His efforts bore fruit. Immediately after the
World's Parliament, John Henry Barrows began an effort to provide PCM
financial support. In December 1893, this resulted in the Mozoomdar
Mission Fund, which allowed PCM to visit the US once more in
1900 [@mullick-2010-FirstHinduMission, 138.]. In October 1894, Caroline E. Haskell gave \$20,000 to the
University of Chicago in order to establish an annual lectureship in
Kolkata. She did so as a direct response to a wish that Mozoomdar had
penned to Barrows earlier that year [These lectures continued until at least 1961. @mullick-2010-FirstHinduMission, 210.]

These and other developments kept PCM active until the summer of 1904,
when his health began to decline sharply. Though his diabetes was under
control, he had contracted tuberculosis, and his deteriorating condition
confined him to his bed by December [@bose-1927-LifeProtapChunder, 360.]. Despite this, PCM spent the
final six months of his life in earnest devotion: his friend and
biographer Suresh Chunder Bose described it as "the conquest of the
love of God over sickness and death." [@bose-1927-LifeProtapChunder, 371.] Mozoomdar died in his
Kolkata home on May 21, 1905, in the company of Saudamini and under the
watchful gaze of Debendranath Tagore and Keshub Sen, whose portraits
hung on the wall nearby [@bose-1927-LifeProtapChunder, 375.]. Though he cannot be said to have fully
realized his ambitions for the Brahmo Samaj, Mozoomdar died at peace, in
the company of loved ones, ready for union with the divine. Perhaps the
two epitaphs inscribed on his monument, written in his own words,
express this best:

> I have done the work that was given to me, I have kept the vow I took.
I have struggled to unfold my message to many men and women. Peace fills
my soul. For all opportunities and facilities, yea for discouragements
and depressions, I have the heart to be grateful to God. His ways are
not our ways, nor His purposes our purposes. But He has amply proved to
me this His great dispensation of the Spirit is sure some day to be the
faith of mankind. Blessed forever be His name.\
\
> I have gained thee with very little spiritual culture, while living
this lowly life on earth. Now I start on my way to gain Thee in a degree
beyond all measure [@bose-1927-LifeProtapChunder, 376-77. The second of these is an English translation from
    Bengali. It is unclear whether Mozoomdar's monument still stands.].
