Two ideas come to mind. One feature of the Religon Department at Columbia is a weekly happy hour when peers can de-stress as a group. By working with the department's social chair, I foresee opportunities to coordinate the timings of CTL programs and happy hours so that the former immediately precede the latter. With the two events in quick succession, and by offering incentives to attend CTL programs in the form of rewards during happy hour (e.g. free/discounted food/drinks or advantages in department-held games), I expect to introduce my peers to CTL resources. Paired with my expectation that, having attended such programs, my peers will become aware of the merits of CTL programs, I expect they will be more likely to attend future programs on their own.

Second, the Religion Department offers a rapid-fire orientation to incoming PhD students with the promise of TA-enrichment programs, yet they are often left to seek out such training on their own. I would encourage revising our orientation process so that incoming PhD students are required to attend at least two programs per semester. By more deliberately incorporating CTL programming into the first-year experiences of incoming PhD students as a cohort, which would be framed equally as a cohort-building exercise and a testament to the value of pedagogical training in the department, I hope that a precedent is set early on that pedagogical enrichment is a staple part of the PhD process.
