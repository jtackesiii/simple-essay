Mozoomdar spent three days traversing the bay. The letters he wrote to
Saudamini during this time reveal a man enraptured by the beauty of the
sea, which he took to be proof of God's immanent presence. Consider his
first impressions of the waters before him:

>The endless expanse of rippling blue is like the open arms of a
mother. The dancing, churning waves crowned with surf are like excited
children, and I their brother whose sight has filled them with joy,
encouraging me to dance, chanting the name of Goddess Anandamayi [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 3.].

Yet Mozoomdar's prose never strays too far from matters of health, and
the account of his first days at sea is ridden with descriptions of
medications and reflections on his constitution. Although expressed as
assurances to Saudamini of his healthiness, Mozoomdar's preoccupation
with details such as whether he slept through the night, the pain in his
hand, his regular consumption of cod liver oil, and his upset stomach
suggests that he continued to worry over his physical condition [Hunyadi JÃ¡nos was a Hungarian aperient spring water that gained popularity in the 1860s. See @-1898-HunyadiJanosNatural].
