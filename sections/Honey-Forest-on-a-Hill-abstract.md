Shortly after the Partition of Pakistan and India, a modest coterie of young women left Karachi to settle in Mount Abu, Rajasthan. Leading them was an elderly man they believed was an avatar of God sent to prepare them for the imminent and apocalyptic end of the Kali Yuga. These were the early Brahma Kumaris, a group which has, in the past seventy years, grown from several hundred to several hundred thousand members. Their corner of Mount Abu has also transformed into an international institutional headquarters and pilgrimage site. This paper is an exploration of the several campuses which comprise the landscape that the Brahma Kumaris affectionately call Madhuban, or "Forest of Honey." Particular attention will be drawn to how this organization has recast mythological Hindu regions, such as the Madhuban of Braj, the Chota Char Dham of Himanchal, and even the Puranic Vaikuntha Loka, in order to invest their infrastructure with religious significance. Analyses of buildings, gardens, landscape paintings, and art installations will demonstrate how the Brahma Kumaris have forged sacred space by alloying these and other religious tropes. Rather than an example of syncretism, the Brahma Kumaris are a touchstone of religious institutions in North India and elsewhere, which routinely retool the sacred in order to fashion meaningful religious resources for contemporary followers.
