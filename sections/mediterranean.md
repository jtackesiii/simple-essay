More than a change of weather, these "European waters" marked a turning
point in Mozoomdar's living conditions and resolve. Having moved to a
cabin further below deck that afforded him additional space and refuge
from the summer sun, he resumed preparations for his
lectures [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 26.]. PCM's writing during this time indicates that he was
preoccupied by issues of character. In a letter written to Saudamini, he
laments the difficulty of maintaining upright behavior amid the "luxury
and sport and decadence" of those aboard the ship [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 26.]. Yet wariness of
the passengers did not detract from Mozoomdar's respect for the crew. In
an article penned for *The Interpreter*, titled "The Organisation of a
British Ship," he lauds the captain and staff for so efficiently
distributing and pursuing their responsibilities:

> There is no interference, no idleness, no intention to deceive, no
insolence, or insubordination. And that is the secret of Government,
either in the church, or in the state, or in the household.... \[Only
then\] can the bark of life steer on its onward course and reach in
safety its remote destination [@mozoomdar-1893-OrganizationBritishShip, 29.].

Here, as elsewhere, Mozoomdar sees in his surroundings the reflection of
God's teachings. Using the relationship of captain and crew as an
example, he encourages complete trust and obedience to God, the
figurative captain at the helm of the "bark of life."
