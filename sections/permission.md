## Request for Research Permission

Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is Nick Tackes, a PhD Student at Columbia University in New York City, USA. My research is an ethnographic/sociological study of religious organizations in Mathura, Uttar Pradesh. In particular, I am investigating the activities, publications, and service projects of the Brahma Kumaris, Krishna Janmsthan Complex, and the Gayatri Pariwar.

I have already been pursuing research in Mathura since July 2019, and I intend to continue my research until April 2020. Upon the request of I.S. Pandey at the Gayatri Tapobhumi, I humbly request for a letter of permission from Shantikunj to continue my research at the Gayatri Tapobhumi, Mathura.

I intend to gather data about the presence of each religious organization in the city of Mathura. Please review the aims of my project in relation to the Gayatri Pariwar organization. My project:

 - will investigate how the Gayatri Pariwar in Mathura has changed since its beginning.
 - will determine the current activities and projects of the Gayatri Pariwar in Mathura.
 - will analyze how these activities contribute Mathura's religious market.

In addition, I intend to gather data about the influence of each religious organization on its members. Please review the aims of my project in relation to Gayatri Pariwar's influence on _parijans_. My project:

 - will investigate how Gayatri _parijans_ make use of the products, literature, and teachings of the Gayatri Pariwar in their lives.
 - will investigate which Gayatri Pariwar activities and service projects _parijans_ most often participate in.
 - will analyze the impact the Gayatri Pariwar has on the lives of its members and of society.

In order to complete these research objectives, I humbly request that you give me the following permissions in the form of a written letter:

 - access (if accompanied by a _parijan_) to all areas of the Gayatri Tapobhumi, Akhand Jyoti Samsthan, and Press.
 - ability to take part in Gayatri Pariwar functions, including the 9-day _shivir_, held at the Tapobhumi or other locations in the Mathura-Vrindavan area.

Please note the following:

 - I already have separate living accommodations in Mathura. I have no need for the Gayatri Pariwar to provide them.
 - My research project has been endorsed by the United States and India Educational Foundation (USIEF) as part of a Fulbright-Hays Doctoral Dissertation Research Award (DDRA). An official letter has been attached to prove this.
 - Upon request, I will provide the Gayatri Pariwar with a copy of my finished research. I hope to build a positive relationship with the Gayatri Pariwar in the course of my research.

Sincerely,
Nick Tackes
