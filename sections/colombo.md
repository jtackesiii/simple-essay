> Dark red waves at the hull give way to ropes of surf embracing the
coast of Sinhala. And then shores of white sand, leading up to the dark
jungles of palm trees. Behind all, mountains tear the bosom of the sky.
Only in the golden Lanka can a sight like this be seen. Pearls are
strewn about everywhere in the seabed. Corals, gems, sandalwood, ivory,
ebony, all you can wish for, as much as you need. Coconuts and areca
palms are floating in the gentle waves. Everything is available, but the
presence of God and true devotion to religion is rare [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 9.].

Mozoomdar's description during his approach to Sri Lanka emphasizes two
of his religious convictions. First, that the mark of God is manifest in
all of the beauty and power of nature. Second, that despite abundant
signs of divine presence, many have lost touch with the spirit of
God [Mozoomdar would later spell out these sentiments before the
    World's Parliament of Religions in his lecture titled “The World's
    Religious Debt to Asia.” See @mozoomdar-1955-LecturesAmericaOther, 15-29.].

PCM stopped for two days in Colombo, welcomed with generosity by
Anagarika Dharmapala, the famous Buddhist revivalist who would also
speak at the World's Parliament of Religions. In a letter to Saudamini,
Mozoomdar extolled the monk's kindness for allowing him to board in his
father's house, feeding him a feast of fresh fruits and vegetables, and
attending to his insomnia by providing good conversation throughout the
night [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 11-12.
