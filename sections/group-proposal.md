_Abstract_:  
Sacred spaces are central to the consolidation of religious and political power, and they are often cast and recast through narratives, whether etched in stone, sung in song, or otherwise. This panel responds to the conference theme, “resistance,” by considering how sacred spaces and their narratives interact with mainstream religious and political powers – sometimes buttressing and other times challenging them. Our presentations highlight a range of media as instrumental in the negotiation of place and the sacred, ranging from architectural features such as _samādhīs_ and city plans to written works including _māhātmyas_, hagiographies, and _kāvya_, to the rituals, performances, and pilgrimages that often bring the two together. We will address the ways that various conceptions of Hindu and Muslim sacred spaces succeed and fail to determine built environments, and vice-versa.

Aalekhya Malladi’s presentation explores the reinforcement of sacred space in a famous pilgrimage site in Tirupati. She will extrapolate the way that the vernacular _māhātmya_ resists and/or reinforces the Sanskrit version, while examining how devotional hagiographies and contemporary rituals reconfigure sacredness in Tirupati. Nick Tackes details the transposition of mainstream Hindu (and other) myths into the art and architecture of the Brahma Kumaris and their headquarters in Mount Abu, Rajasthan. Examining material and architectural remains along with archival material, Rachel Hirsch will study the intersection of religious and political realms in Faruqi Burhanpur. Aditya Chaturvedi will study how sayujya of a 20th century King with Kali through a text and his samadhi to conceptualize regional identity.

The four panelists are graduate students in the departments of Religion and Art History. The moderator, Dr. Harshita Kamath, is Visweswara Rao and Sita Koppaka Assistant Professor in Telugu Culture, Literature and History at Emory University.
