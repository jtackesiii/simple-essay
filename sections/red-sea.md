Mozoomdar had cause to feel lonely. For the past decade, he had been
struggling to reconcile the warring Brahmo Samaj factions in the wake of
Keshub Chunder Sen's controversies and death, with little success.
Bereft of his friend and alienated from other Brahmos because of that
friendship, PCM became the object of scorn by many Brahmos who felt
threatened by the idea that he might try to succeed Keshub as leader of
the group [@bose-1927-LifeProtapChunder, 114-15.]. For Mozoomdar, whose global aspirations for the Brahmo
Samaj and its New Dispensation were more pronounced than most, the
opportunity to leave such squabbles behind in order to bring Keshub's
vision to life in the West was surely a welcome one.

Yet Mozoomdar expressed disappointment in the behavior of his shipmates.
In a piece he wrote for *The Interpreter*, titled "Red Sea, Why Red,"
PCM suggests that the Red Sea is so-named because of the excruciating
heat experienced when traveling its waters. With tongue in cheek, he
writes that even "the freezing attitude of his fellow passengers" cannot
cool him down [@mozoomdar-1893-RedSeaWhy, 27.]. Though there is no evidence that anyone treated him
poorly at sea (to the contrary, he describes being pampered by a British
servant named Harris, who massaged him with medicinal oils),[@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 21.] PCM
expressed to Saudamini that religious life aboard the ship did not meet
his expectations. After several Sundays without the promised religious
services, Mozoomdar resigned himself to dissatisfaction, writing "it
turns out that neither Kolkata nor this ship can afford me those
luxuries." [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 16.] Without friends or occasions for religious fulfillment,
and sweltering in the sun besides, Mozoodmdar was not at his best upon
the Red Sea.
