If the applause of his listeners aboard the RMS Umbria humbled
Mozoomdar, the sight of the New York harbor once again inspired him to
eloquence. Describing it as "one of the most picturesque in the world,"
Mozoomdar wrote of forested islands, the to-and-fro of ferries and
barges, and "the mass of buildings, some of them fifteen stories high,"
which gleamed against the cobalt sky [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 51-52.]. His stay in New York was
brief.

On Sunday 3 September, he lectured for the congregation of the
late Henry Ward Beecher, acclaimed preacher and abolitionist, who had
died six years earlier. According to newspaper reports, Mozoomdar began
his sermon with a reference to his 1883 visit, during which he had met
Beecher himself. He then proceeded along a familiar refrain: "Do you
want to know the profound thoughts in the mind of the Infinite? Look out
before you on the face of nature, where on his right hand hath he
scribed himself." [@-1893-HinduPlymouthChurch, 7.] PCM's call for a turn toward nature would feature
prominently in his parliament addresses as well. He thought that
westerners in general, and Americans in particular, remained too
occupied with labor and industry to see the spirit of God. In fact, he
saw confirmation of this in the chalky complexions of New Yorkers, which
he attributed to "overwork on the part of men, and metaphysics on the
part of young ladies." [@mozoomdar-1893-WayChicago, 52.] Following his own advice, he left the
following day -- Labor Day -- to enjoy the view of Niagara Falls before
proceeding to Chicago.
