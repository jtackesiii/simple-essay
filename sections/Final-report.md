Due to the onset of COVID-19, I was forced to end my research stint in India one week early. Despite being slightly abbreviated, the past nine months of research have borne fruit. As indicated in my midterm report, I felt compelled to alter the scope and focus of my research slightly during the course of research. These alterations were the natural results of becoming more familiar with my research subjects and what they professed to be important, as well as developments in India's political landscape over the course of 2019-2020. Further, as I grew more accustomed to my research site, I began to think generatively about things I had not even considered when writing my grant proposals. I happily summarize some of my key findings and experiences below.

1. Changes in focus and scope

Initially my project was titled "Self-help and -care in Contemporary North India." Although I maintain that self-help and self-care are important concepts through which to understand contemporary religion in North India, these were not terms used by my informants. In fact, self-help in India generally refers to a different set of practices than in the US (it has much more to do with rural development than character development). What I found to be more important than these concepts was the idea of the religious institution as a specific type of entity: a semi-autonomous economy that often provides members teachings, products, services, and sometimes employment. The religious institution as an entity encourages us to rethink what religious belonging in India today looks like.

Changing my focus to the model of religious institutions also encouraged me to change the scope of my research. I forsook the Pananjali company of Baba Ramdev as a target of research for two reasons. First, Baba Ramdev's intolerance of Western researchers discouraged me from writing about the companies he leads. Second, there was very little in Mathura other than several Patanjali stores through which to investigate the Patanjali company as a religious institution; in fact, those I spoke with emphasized that I would not find anything interesting by spending time in Patanjali stores. Instead, and after discovering fascinating historical, infrastructural, and theological points of comparison, I decided to investigate the Brahma Kumaris alongside the Gayatri Pariwar as two religious institutions of importance. Alongside growing interest in the shape of religious life in Mathura as a city, I also decided to look into the Krishna Janmsthan Complex of Mathura, one of the city's prominent pilgrimage attractions.

2. Findings

Throughout months of converstions with informants in the Gayatri Pariwar and Brahma Kumaris, participation in religious conferences and retreats, attending annual events, etc. I have articulated several themes of importance. First, I came to discover the prominence of "energy" and "vibrations" as important concepts. Attention to energy and vibrations is key to understanding the doubled projects of both the Gayatri Pariwar and Brahma Kumaris, which at once aim to serve individuals and society at large. To these organizations, care of the self is very much related to the ability to help, heal, and purify one's surroundings and society. The link between the individual body and the environment (which I read as a proxy for society at large and even the "age" or _yuga_ in which we live) is the connective property of energy and vibrations.

Very related to the concept of energy and vibrations is the importance of manufactured goods in religious institutions as the instruments of creating, transforming, and/or transferring energy and vibrations. Many of these items appear decorative -- an item for a household shrine, a nightlight, a small music box. Yet they are used to create a certain type of religious environment, which in turn is understood to help people cultivate and spread a certain type of energy or vibration. Other products are more medicinal: tooth powder, soap, incense, and tea are sold through the Gayatri Pariwar. Not just the consumption, but the manufacture of these products are of vital importance to the operations of religious institutions. Both organizations have manufacturing facilities for textiles, paper goods, multimedia productions, etc. The creation of sources of revenue for institutions and their members is vital to the survival of these religious organizations.

A third finding, and one I am still grappling with, is the idea of the "center," not only as a metaphor but also as an architectural reality. Mathura as a city is understood to be a religious center, yet it has been decentered by the rise to prominence of Vrindavan a few kilometers north. Further, the development of the Krishna Janmsthan Complex since the mid-1980s has moved the "heart" of Mathura West from its prior place on the shoreline of the Yamuna River. The Gayatri Pariwar's Mathura campus used to be the organization's center, but since the 1970s the headquarters has shifted to Haridwar, changing the role of the city for the group. A recent flourishing of Brahma Kumaris spaces, often called "centers," have cropped up in Mathura in the past 15 years. Yet a recent ordinance forbidding men to operate these centers has left the recently converted home of a male member with an ambiguous space. For each example, I have asked myself what can be said about the "decentered center." I have found that members of religious institutions negotiate the no-longer-center status of their locations by attempting to align the efforts of their localities with the new center and/or articulating the unique contributions that their locality make to their larger institutions.
