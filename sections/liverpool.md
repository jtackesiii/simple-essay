Amid his public engagements, Mozoomdar only managed to compose three
letters to Saudamini in London. His writing reflects how he spent his
moments of respite. Whether catching up with the Spears' at Arundel
house, sitting amid the fruit trees of their garden, or chatting with
B.B. Nagarkar, a Brahmo friend who would travel with him to Chicago, PCM
had occasions to relax in good company. Yet his letters suggest that he
was plagued with uncertainties during his brief moments of rest. Shaken
by the discovery of a friend's death in India, he writes, "How can I be
assured of anything after this?" [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 38.] Likely in an effort to shore up
uncertainties regarding his own health, Mozoomdar redoubled his
authoritative tone to Saudamini, demanding that she pray for him every
day, finish her work, and prepare herself for heaven [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 38.]. Similarly, in
a letter written the evening before his departure for the Liverpool
Harbor, PCM assures Saudamini -- and himself -- that: "I am well. People
in England told me that my features haven't changed at all in these ten
years. I don't find that believable in the slightest, but so many people
said this that it would have made you happy." [@mozoomdar-2018-LettersWrittenProtapchandra, 39-40.] Having thus attempted
to comfort himself, Mozoomdar boarded the RMS Umbria bound for New York
on 26 August.
