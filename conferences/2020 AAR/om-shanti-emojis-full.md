# Om Shanti Emojis: Three Facets of Digital Hinduism

The following essay responds to three scholars' contributions to the edited volume _Digital Hinduism_ (2020) by situating their pronouncements regarding the role of digital media in contemporary religious practice into the contexts of two Hindu new religious movements: the Brahma Kumaris and the Gayatri Pariwar. These institutions are underrepresented in studies of Hinduism, and their members engage with digital media in ways that reinforce, and sometimes challenge, the conclusions of existing scholarship on digital Hinduism. The following analysis of several case studies wherein members of the Gayatri Pariwar and the Brahma Kumaris use digital media will demonstrate three things: (1) an increasing supply of digital religious resources creates new expectations for proper religious conduct (i.e. new demands); (2) social media forums serve as venues for both the performance and policing of piety; (3) the digital content that populates these forums exist at the threshold of deliberate ritual practice and what has been called "automatic" or "accidental" ritual [see @Haberman-2014-AccidentalRitualist; @Karapanagiotis-2019-AutomaticRitualsInadvertent].

## Recent Scholarship

Attention to the role of digital media in religious practice is no longer new. The recently published volume _Digital Hinduism_ begins from the premise that all forthcoming analyses of contemporary Hinduism must account for how their religious subjects make use of social media, websites, smartphone applications, or other technological innovations.
