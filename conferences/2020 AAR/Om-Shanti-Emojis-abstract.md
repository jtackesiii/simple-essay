Based on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in 2019-2020, This paper offers an investigation of the Brahma Kumaris and the Gayatri Pariwar as case studies with which to reflect on and respond to "digital Hinduism." An analysis of three facets of digital religious practice demonstrates the instrumentality of online media in the negotiation and production of religious identity and community. An overview of (1) the wide range of religious products offered by both institutions via websites and social media platforms will be followed by ethnographic consideration of (2) the production and upkeep of both online resources and the digital realms in which people access them. These characterizations of the supply side of digital religion will set the stage for a sustained engagement with (3) the ways that members of the Brahma Kumaris and Gayatri Pariwar utilize Facebook and WhatsApp as platforms for the digitalized performance of piety.
